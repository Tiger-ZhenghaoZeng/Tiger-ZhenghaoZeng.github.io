I'm a PhD student in [Statistics at Carnegie Mellon University](http://stat.cmu.edu/) where I am lucky to be advised by [Aaditya Ramdas](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~aramdas/).

Before coming to CMU, I studied math and statistics at the University of Waterloo in Canada.

I am broadly interested in statistical theory and methodology under weak assumptions, often in adaptive and sequential settings. For example, I focus on
* Anytime-valid sequential inference,
* Nonparametric methods,
* Causal inference,
* Reinforcement learning, and
* Differential privacy.
