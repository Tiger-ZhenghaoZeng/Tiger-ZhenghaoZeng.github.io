Welcome to my research page! I'm a PhD student in Statistics at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://stat.cmu.edu/) where I am lucky to be advised by [Aaditya Ramdas](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~aramdas/).

Before joining CMU, I studied Math and Statistics at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/). I have also been fortunate enough to collaborate with scientists from [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/) and [SickKids](https://www.sickkids.ca/).

## Research interests
I am broadly interested in Statistics and Machine Learning with a current focus on:
* Anytime-valid sequential inference,
* Nonparametric methods,
* Causal inference, and
* Applications to public health, policy, and medicine.
