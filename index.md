Hi there! Welcome to my home page under construction! I'm a fourth-year PhD student in [Statistics at Carnegie Mellon University](http://stat.cmu.edu/), where I am so fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Edward H. Kennedy](https://www.ehkennedy.com/).

Before coming to CMU, I studied math and statistics at University of Science and Technology of China(USTC).

I am broadly interested in statistical theory and methodology for causal inference, often based on semiparametric efficiency theory. Topics includes:
* Generalizability and transportability,
* Instrumental variable methods,
* Hetergeneous effects estimation,
* Continuous treatment effect (dose response) estimation,
* Causal inference in high-dimensional problems.
