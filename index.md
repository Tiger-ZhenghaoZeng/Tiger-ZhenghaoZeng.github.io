# About Me

Welcome to my research page! I'm a PhD student in Statistics at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://stat.cmu.edu/) where I am lucky to be advised by [Aaditya Ramdas](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~aramdas/). 

Before joining CMU, I studied Math and Statistics at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/).

## Research interests
I am broadly interested in Statistics and Machine Learning with a current focus on:
* Sequential analysis,
* Causal inference from observational and experimental data,
* Semiparametric and nonparametric methodology, and
* Applications to public health, policy, and medicine.

## Selected publications

1. [Confidence sequences for sampling without replacement](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.04347.pdf)\\
	I. Waudby-Smith and A. Ramdas.\\
	NeurIPS, accepted (2020).
