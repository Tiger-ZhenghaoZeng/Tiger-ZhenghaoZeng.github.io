Welcome to my research page! I'm a PhD student in [Statistics at Carnegie Mellon University](http://stat.cmu.edu/) where I am lucky to be advised by [Aaditya Ramdas](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~aramdas/). Before joining CMU, I studied math at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/).

I am broadly interested in Statistics and Machine Learning with a current focus on:
* Anytime-valid sequential inference,
* Causal inference, and
* Nonparametric estimation and testing.

## Selected papers

- [Doubly robust confidence sequences for sequential causal inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.06476.pdf)\\
    I. Waudby-Smith, D. Arbour, R. Sinha, E.H. Kennedy, and A. Ramdas

- [Estimating means of bounded random variables by betting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.09686.pdf)\\
	I. Waudby-Smith and A. Ramdas

- [Confidence sequences for sampling without replacement](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.04347.pdf)\\
	I. Waudby-Smith and A. Ramdas\\
	NeurIPS (2020)
