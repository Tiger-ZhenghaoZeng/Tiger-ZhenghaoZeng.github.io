# [rbtt](https://wannabesmith.github.io/rbtt)

![rbtt_density](/images/rbtt_density.png)

rbtt is an R package for computing an alternative bootstrap-based t-test aiming to reduce type-I error for non-negative, zero-inflated data.

Get it now by running:

```
install.packages("rbtt")
```

See more information on the [rbtt page](https://wannabesmith.github.io/rbtt/) or view the package [on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rbtt)


# Multi-State Modelling In Chronic Kidney Disease

![msm_transitions](/images/msm_state_transitions.png)

A project I worked on while at Cancer Care Ontario under the supervision of Dr. Zhihui (Amy) Liu.
Presented at the Statistical Society of Canada conference in May/June 2016.

**Abstract:
"We consider multi-state models aimed at projecting the prevalence of chronic kidney disease and the cost of its treatment in Ontario. Compared to using time-series methods to predict aggregate patient counts, both short and long term projections can benefit from an individual-level modeling approach by capturing the entire disease progression and treatment history and incorporating patient-level characteristics. We model the transitions from healthy state to pre-dialysis, through various dialysis modalities such as home and in-facility dialysis, to attrition. We then simulate each patient's future trajectories, which can be translated to measures such as patient years and treatment costs."**

# [Twiki](https://wannabesmith.github.io/twiki)

![twiki](/images/twiki.png)

Twiki was a service that allows people to retrieve simple information from Wikipedia via SMS. It was built by 4 University students at a weekend-long hackathon called [DeltaHacks](http://deltahacks.com/).

# [SVN-shelve](https://wannabesmith.github.io/SVN-Shelve)

SVN-shelve is an open-source tool I adapted while working as a Developer (co-op) at PureFacts Financial Solutions. It acts as a subversion analogue to [git-stash](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Tools-Stashing).

# Arduino lie detector

![lie_detector_circuit](/images/lie_detector_circuit.jpg)

In this circuits course project, we exploited the effects of electrodermal activity (sometimes referred to as galvanic skin response) to detect when a person may be telling a lie. The original concept was taken from "30 Arduino Projects for the Evil Genius" by Simon Monk.
